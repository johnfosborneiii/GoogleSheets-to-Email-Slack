# GoogleSheets-to-Email-Slack
This is a Google Apps Scripts project which takes a spreadsheet and autosends an email as well as copies to  your clipboard for slack

## Currently WIP

Some values are hard coded still.

Additionally, there is a slack bug where it does not auto-format the table as code when pasting the 3 backticks so you need to highlight the table as mark it as code so it formats properly
